# ANB.Finance
# What is ANB
ANB is the second DEFI farm project of CLAM HOLDINGS. This is a test product that allows multi-chain parallel transactions. When the CLAM project starts, we can see that trading media such as ANB/BTC, ANB/ETH will be as fast, simple and sovereign as ANB/TRX. This is worth looking forward to!

ANB is distributed in the DEFI reward model. Random rewards and halving rules make ANB have higher profitability and higher liquidity. Its characteristics are:

Open source contract code
The aggregation mode
Decentralized publishing
Governance to ensure stability
Completely achieved the chain management: decentralizing from the beginning
Establish a fair distribution mechanism to encourage the members of the community to take the responsibility consciously

# Future planning
ANB will be controlled entirely by the owners of ANB in the future. Although, the intrinsic value of ANB is zero, the way emerging assets are controlled through community governance may generate investment value. The ANB ownership community will determine and update the features of the ANB agreement, including the use of predictive computers, repurchase functions, inflation, incentive mechanism design, ANB gold bank, etc. Any future allocation of capital would ultimately be controlled by ANB token holders, as would any yield it might generate. In theory, such a reserve vault could add robustness and security to the agreement if ANB holders are properly nurtured.

# How will ANB be released
ANB will be distributed entirely in the spirit of community autonomy, with no tokens allocated to the founding team, no upfront payments, no founder shares, and no VC benefits.

ANB 1500
CLAM-TRX 3500
ANB-TRX 10000
EAB-TRX 2000
Reward pool is halved every 7 days,After the initial distribution pool is launched, ANB will stimulate the second wave distribution through the ANB/TRX Justswap pool. This pool will allow Justswap provide the liquidity and necessary inputs for the repurchase based on the TWAP price predictor.
